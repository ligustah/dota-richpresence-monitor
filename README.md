This is a steam bot based on nodejs that can track a player's RichPresence status for Dota 2 and trigger hotkeys on certain state changes. It was used to select appropriate scenes on OBS depending on the state I was in (e.g. "Finding match"). The code is from early 2016 and at the time of writing hasn't been used for over a year.  
It should be platform-independent, though I have only tested in on Windows and Ubuntu Linux.

# Configuration
Have a look at the `config/` folder
